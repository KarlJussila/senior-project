# senior-project
I created this project for my senior project in high school in 2018-2019. The project was about game design more than game development, so the game is incomplete. It is a tile-based RPG built in Python 3 with Pygame and PyTMX for level creation.

### Installation
- Install Python 3
- Install Pygame
- Install PyTMX
- Run main.py with Python 3
